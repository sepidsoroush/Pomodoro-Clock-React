# ‚è∞ **Pomodoro Clock**

The aim of Pomodoro Clock (AKA 25+5 Clock) is to help you focus on any task you are working on, such as study, writing, or coding. This app is inspired by Pomodoro Technique which is a time management method. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by 5 minutes short breaks.
